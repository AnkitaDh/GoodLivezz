6 out of 10 people are suffering from Chronic Diseases. The same could have been prevented or controlled with some daily routine changes. As of today, we have around 10 doctors per 10,000 people on the planet. This is approximately 0.1% global coverage. Compare that with the worldwide internet reach, which stands at about 62% of today's global population. Lifestyle diseases stem from an imbalanced daily routine which personal routine improvements of an individual can effectively solve.

Even today, health concerns overshadow a significant part of financial prosperity in many developing developing countries. Surely, there is a technological vacancy waiting to be plugged in, and it was precisely this reason that motivated us to chose this specific goal. We try to bridge the gap between an ordinary person and their right to a healthier life.
